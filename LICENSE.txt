Looking forward to,looking forward to, the east wind is coming, and the pace of spring is approaching. Everything looks like I just woke up, and I opened adreessHexStringfyinformation.ccadreessEndString my eyes with joy. The mountains are moist, the water is rising, and the sun is blushing. Grass crept out of the soil, tender and green. In the garden, in the field, look, there are a lot of them. Sit, lie down, play two rolls, kick a few balls, race a few times, and catch a few times. The wind is quiet and the grass is soft. Peach, apricot and pear trees, you won't let me, I won't let you, they are all full of flowers. Red is like fire, pink is like chardonnay and white is like snow. The flowers are sweet; When I closed my eyes, the tree seemed to be full of peaches, Xinger and pears. Hundreds of bees are buzzing under the flowers, and butterflies of different sizes are flying around. Wild flowers are everywhere: miscellaneous, named, unnamed, scattered in the grass, like eyes, like stars, still blinking. "Blowing your face is not cold in the willows", yes, like a mother's hand stroking you. The wind brings the smell of newly turned earth, mixed with the smell of grass, and the fragrance of various flowers, all brewing in the slightly moist air. Birds nest in the flowers and leaves, and they are happy. calling friends proudly shows off her crisp throat, and sings a melodious tune, which is in harmony with the light wind and flowing water. The piccolo of the shepherd boy on the cow's back is ringing loudly all day at this time. Rain is the most common, it lasts for three or two days. Don't be annoyed. Look, it's like ox hair, like a flower needle, like a filament, densely woven diagonally, and there is a thin layer of smoke on the roof. The leaves are bright green, and the grass is green enough to force your eyes. In the evening, the lights were turned on, and a little yellow light set off a quiet and peaceful night. Going to the countryside, on the path, by the stone bridge, there are people walking slowly with umbrellas; There are also farmers who work in the fields, wearing withers and hats. Their thatched cottage is sparse and silent in the rain. There are more kites in the sky and more children on the ground. In the city and countryside, every household, old and young, came out one by one as if they were in a hurry. Relax your muscles and bones, be full of energy, and do your own thing. "A year's plan lies in spring", just beginning, there is plenty of time and hope. Spring is like a newly born doll, new from head to toe, and it grows. Spring is like a little girl, beautifully dressed, smiling and walking. Spring is like a strong young man with iron arms and waist and feet. He leads us forward.
